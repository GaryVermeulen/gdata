"""
A pure Python "ping" implementation, based on a rewrite by Johannes Meyer,
of a script originally by Matthew Dixon Cowles. Which in turn was derived
from "ping.c", distributed in Linux's netkit. The version this was forked
out of can be found here: https://gist.github.com/pklaus/856268
The versions this script derived from are licensed under GPL v2, this makes
mandatory that this is licensed under the same terms as well. If it were up
to me I would have made this edit MIT licensed, sorry for not being able to.
I've rewritten nearly everything for enhanced performance and readability,
and removed unnecessary functions (assynchroneous PingQuery and related).
Those of the original comments who still applied to this script were kept.
This new revision is almost fully compliant with Python 3, and packs several
improvements including: Modular importing, better use of operators, overall
code cleanup, separated verbose mode into a dedicated function, added
generator mode to recursive function and others...
A lot was changed on my rewrite, and as far as my tests went it is working
quite beautifully. In any case, bug reports are very much welcome.
Please note that ICMP messages can only be sent by processes ran as root.
