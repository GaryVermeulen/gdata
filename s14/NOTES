S14 -- Rewrite of S13

June 2024; Current iteration of Simple-Ton -- Don't blink for it will have changed.
Highly volative.

Current process order:
      
   1) processRawKB.py           -!- Builds starter MongoDb KB collection from started KB text file. Too broard--break into small ontologies.
   2) processRawinflections.py  -.- Builds a MongoDB inflection collection from text file. May not need due to Spacy?
   3) processRawCorpora.py      -.- Tokenize, tag w/Spacy, build pickle output.
   4) processSO.py		-*- Extract subjects and ojects and compare/add to simple KBs
   5) processPronouns.py	-*- Map pronouns to nouns.
