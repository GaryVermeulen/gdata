But I rang his doorbell.
“Hi,” I said in a bubbly voice. “My name is Allie Kay and I live down the street.”“Nice to meet you,” he said. “I am Ted but my Grandchildren call me Pop Pop, and you can too. Oh, I see you have a very pretty goldfish.
What’s his name?” “Moebus,” I replied. Pop Pop continued. “Moebus looks like he needs his water changed, come on out back to my fishpond
and we will refresh him.”
Pop Pop said. “Allie Kay, you are a very responsible young person.You recognized that Moebus was a little under the weather and got him some help. Others may have just let him live in dirty water, getting sicker, and sicker. You must really love Moebus.”   “Oh! I do,” I said. “Moebus is my first pet.  Will he be alright?”
At that, Pop Pop put Moebus in the fishpond with all the other fish.
I started to say something and Pop Pop said. “Don’t worry. Let’s get Moebus a bigger bowl (I’ll trade you this small one for a big one).”
How could I refuse? Pop Pop then gave me a big bowl and said go get some gravel, wash it, put it in the bowl, and fill the bowl with water. I did and by the time I was done, Pop Pop had Moebus in a net and ready for his new home. My mom and I thanked Pop Pop and as we were leaving, he said two things. To me - “Remember to change his water every three days and if you need help please ask.”  To my mom – “You must be proud to have  such a responsible and caring pet owner as your daughter.”
As mom and I stood by the table and watched Moebus swimming in his new home, she gave me a hug and said, “I am glad you got your first pet.”
