Simpleton is a hobby research project exploring the possibility of an AGI model
that starts with a very small lexicon/KB. 

The idea is from how a human child learns. A child does not start with 
terabytes of “trained” data, so the idea is to build from a starter data set 
and dynamically grow the KB. Another goal is comprehension without prediction, 
so obviously a nontrivial and very possibly an unsolvable problem.

And no, Eleanor, at this point in time Simpleton is neither eloquent or
efficient.
