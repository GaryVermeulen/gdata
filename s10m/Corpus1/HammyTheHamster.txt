I am Hammy the Hamster.
I live with my mother Henrietta, my father Harry, my sister Hachi, and my brother Hal.
We live in South America and you can’t miss our home.
It is the burrow under the trees that look like the letter H.
When we are out during the day, we are very careful so we aren’t caught.
We might get trapped and become someone’s pet.
So we are mostly out after dark.
We like to eat seeds and fruit and can carry it back home in our pouches.
Our cheeks have built in shopping bags.
Just like you, we like to play  and have fun.
We have fun running into the light and chasing our shadows on the leaves.
Last night Hachi and I found this thing. 
When you pushed a button, it lit up like the sun.
We like to climb things and explore.
Our cousins Lester, Larry, and Lorain live in the city.
They are someone’s pet.
They sent us this picture and said they had a lot of fun but missed playing with us.
Lester said he liked people.
He always had food and water and lots of toys to play with.
He even likes to take a ride in the pocket of his people friend, Billy.
I might be your pet some day.
If I ever become your pet, I hope you take good care of me because I will do all I can to be your friend.
Adios Amigos.
