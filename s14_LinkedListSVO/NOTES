S14 -- Rewrite of S13

June 2024; Current iteration of Simple-Ton -- Don't blink for it will have 
changed--Highly volative.

Current process order:
----------------------

1) processRawKB.py

 Builds starter MongoDb KB collection from started KB text file. 
 Too broard--break into smaller ontologies.
                                    
2) processRawinflections.py

 Builds a MongoDB inflection collection from text file. 
 May not need due to Spacy?
                                    
3) processRawCorpora.py

 Tokenize (non-Spacy), uses Spacy for tagging and SVO identification, build 
 pickle output.
 Spacy is not perfect--may need something to handle errors/inconsistencies...~?
                                    
4) processSVOs.py

 Extract subjects and ojects and compare/add to simple KBs?????
 Will help identify pronouns in next step (he/she, etc.).
 Adding home-grown SVO extraction to compare with Spacy...
                                    
5) resolvePronouns.py
 Map pronouns to nouns.
 Much work ahead.
