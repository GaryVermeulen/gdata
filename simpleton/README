Simpleton (From Sponge Bob SquarePants: Simple-Ton, 
A ton of simple things to do.) is a POC project which 
is not intended for production or scaleup and is 
neither efficient nor eloquent.

It is an exploration and an exercise to start an AI 
model small with very little data (currently 28 words),
and to develop learning algorithms that are not based 
on using predictive techniques on large a lexicon or corpus.

The idea is from the understanding that a child does not 
read million-word corpora to understand 
“See Dick run with the ball”.
